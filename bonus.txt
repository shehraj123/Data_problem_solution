Hypothesis-

From the scatter plot as well as the data regarding density, popularisty of each POI can be deduced for comparison. Ranking
each POI by the order of popularity, 

POI1 > POI3 > POI4

Assuming longitudes and latitudes to be in correct orientation, directions that correspond to the sides are
Left -> South
Right -> North
Top -> West
Bottom -> East

POI 1 receives a lot of crowd for the southern part of the area, while POI 3 gets most requests from southern/western part. 
POI 4 seres the least requests with some of the requests that are far from hot regions.

Points that lie on the perpendicular bisector of POI1 and POI 3 are assigned POI1 because of lexicographical priority. But the assignment
of these points remain ambiguous and could have assigned POI 3 as well.

The scatter plots form clusters and on the smaller scale seem to have a chaining structure. For example around POI 1, there are multiple chaining
spikes, that indicate certain network externality involved in the trade at POI 1. Since the scatter plots dont have too much standard deviation, except POI4,
which serves the requests farthest from the geographical region, we can deduce the type of item being traded at POI 1 & 3. Since they form clusters, the good/service seems to be
exclusively available at these POIs. 

This data also resembles requests served by a network tower installed in a big region that is optimized to serve the most amount of requests.
